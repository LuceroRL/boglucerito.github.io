          Some betrayals can only come from someone who had access to your heart.
          She knew where it hurt and chose to use it. She made you feel small so
          she could rise. And that kind of pain hits differently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Betrayal in friendship comes as a shock, because you never expect it.
          You trusted, and that doesn't make you weak or foolish—it makes you
          human. She is the one who failed, not you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Losing a friend like that hurts, but it also sets you free. It teaches
          you to set boundaries, to stop justifying what hurts, and to choose
          yourself.
        </p>

        <p>
          You deserve friendships that lift you up, not use you. Her betrayal
          does not define your worth. Your ability to heal does.

          <h2>What Love Really Means</h2>

          Falling in love is the most pathetic thing in the world. Sometimes it happens 
          by chance and sometimes it happens by destiny. What hurts the most is that this 
          was a simple coincidence while all along I thought it was a matter of destiny.
        </p>

        <p>
          How do you know they're the right person? Do you need a manual to have a 
          relationship? The truth is, you don't.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've learned that loving is much more than falling in love, and sometimes 
          stopping loving someone is also loving yourself. And in the end, if you choose 
          the person, it's to learn and find their unique way of loving.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because a relationship is an agreement between two people, but always forming 
          a 100% of love, trust, honesty, and empathy. Of course there are difficult 
          moments, but the important thing is to always reach a mutual agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          And when something bothers you or you don't agree, say it. Don't keep things 
          to yourself because you deserve to be heard—you are one in a million.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't give more love than you are receiving!!!!!
